knowledge transfer (15 minutes), 2) knowledge application and implementation (40 minutes) and 3) retrospective (5 minutes).
Based on the discussion from the previous session, the developer experience getâ€™s
increased to be comparable to frameworks like React. Therefore, Typescript dec-
orators get introduced and explained how they can be used for classes, properties
and methods. By means of them, we can then outsource extensive parts of de-
velopment to a small library of self build decorators, which can than be used
with any web component. After this session, the attendees know how decorators
are working and how to extend web components practically.
